# Equation
The tool uses the following equation to calculate the daily impressions and daily budget:

Daily Impressions
=
Booked Impressions Goal/  Total Days
​
 

Daily Budget Required
=
( Daily Impressions × CPM/ 1000 ) × Total Days


Where:

Booked Impressions Goal

Booked Impressions Goal is the total number of impressions you aim to achieve during the entire campaign.

Total Days
Total Days is the total number of days between the start and end dates of the campaign.

CPM
CPM is the cost per mile, which is the cost for 1,000 impressions.

Example
If a campaign has a booked impressions goal of 50,000, a total budget of $10,000, and runs for 20 days with a CPM of $2, the tool will calculate:

Daily Impressions Needed: 2,500
Daily Budget Required: $50
